For general pages, the process is slightly different as they are built with a visual tool called Elementor.

3.  Hover over the page you want to edit and click **Edit with Elementor**.
4.  The page will open in a new, visual editor.
5.  To change any text, simply **click directly on the text on the page**. A text editor will appear on the left side of the screen. Make your changes there.
6.  The changes will appear on the page preview instantly.
7.  When you are happy with your edits, click the green **Update** button at the bottom-left of the screen.

That's it! These are the main tasks you'll need to keep your website's content fresh and up-to-date.
