# Developer Guide and Project Analysis

## Part 1: Project Analysis and Feedback

**Overall Assessment:**

The project documentation for the "ПЧЕЛА МЕДИК" (Pchyolka Medic) clinic website is exceptionally thorough, well-structured, and professional. It provides a comprehensive foundation for development, leaving very little ambiguity. The decision-making process is transparent, and the technical planning is detailed and sound. This is a model example of how to prepare for a web development project.

**Key Strengths:**

*   **Clear Rationale for Technology Stack:** The shift from a complex Django solution to a more practical WordPress implementation is brilliantly justified in the `docs/technical/wordpress_solution.md` document. The analysis correctly identifies the client's non-technical background, budget constraints, and core requirements as the primary drivers for this decision. This client-centric approach is crucial for project success.
*   **Detailed and Actionable Architecture:** The `docs/technical/wordpress_architecture.md` file is a robust technical blueprint. It covers everything from server setup and database structure to a precise list of plugins, security measures, and SEO best practices. A developer can use this document as a definitive checklist to build the site.
*   **Comprehensive Scope Definition:** The documentation clearly outlines what is included in the "WordPress Lite MVP" and, just as importantly, what is excluded (e.g., online booking, patient portals). This clarity is vital for managing client expectations and preventing scope creep.
*   **Beginner-Friendly Resources:** The inclusion of recommended themes (like MediPlus) and a detailed implementation plan makes the project accessible even to developers who are not WordPress experts.

**Conclusion:**

The planning phase of this project is complete and has been executed to a very high standard. The existing documentation is more than sufficient to move forward with development. The plan is logical, the technology choice is appropriate, and the success criteria are clearly defined.

### Phase 1: Initial Server and WordPress Setup

This phase is about getting your foundation ready.

1.  **Set Up a Hosting Environment:**
    *   The client uses **Sprinthost**. You will need access to their hosting control panel.
    *   If you want to develop locally first (recommended), you can use a tool like **LocalWP** or a **Docker** container with a WordPress image. This creates a safe sandbox on your computer.

2.  **Install WordPress:**
    *   Most hosting panels (including Sprinthost) have a "one-click" WordPress installer. Use it. It will ask for a site title and admin username/password.
    *   If installing manually or in Docker, you'll need to create a MySQL database first, then upload the WordPress files and run the famous "5-minute install."

3.  **Initial WordPress Configuration:**
    *   Log in to your new WordPress admin panel (usually at `yourdomain.com/wp-admin`).
    *   Go to **Settings > General**. Set the `Site Title`, `Tagline`, `Timezone`, and `Site Language` (Russian).
    *   Go to **Settings > Permalinks**. Change the setting to **Post name**. This makes your URLs clean and SEO-friendly (e.g., `.../services/uzi/` instead of `.../?p=123`). This is very important!

### Phase 2: Installing the Theme and Essential Plugins

Now we add the core functionality and look-and-feel.

1.  **Install the Theme:**
    *   The recommended theme is **MediPlus**. You will need to purchase and download the theme's `.zip` file from the theme marketplace (like ThemeForest).
    *   In the WordPress admin, go to **Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme**.
    *   Select the `.zip` file you downloaded and click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.

2.  **Install the Plugins:**
    *   The architecture document lists many plugins. Let's install them in groups. Go to **Plugins > Add New** for each one.
    *   **Search, Install, and Activate** the following plugins one by one:

    *   **Content Structure:**
        *   `Custom Post Type UI` (To create "Services" and "Doctors" sections).
        *   `Advanced Custom Fields` (To add special fields like "Price" to services).
        *   `Elementor` (The main page builder, the theme may prompt you to install this).

    *   **Functionality:**
        *   `Contact Form 7` (For creating contact forms).
        *   `WP Mail SMTP` (To make sure emails from forms don't go to spam).
        *   `Click to Chat` (For the WhatsApp button).

    *   **Performance:**
        *   `WP Super Cache` (To make the site fast).
        *   `Smush` (To optimize images automatically).

    *   **Security & Backups:**
        *   `Wordfence Security` (A firewall and security scanner).
        *   `UpdraftPlus` (For automatic backups).

    *   **SEO:**
        *   `Yoast SEO` (The best plugin for search engine optimization).

### Phase 3: Creating the Custom Content Structure

This is the most important part of organizing the site's information. We will create dedicated sections for "Services" and "Doctors" so the client can easily manage them.

1.  **Create the "Services" Post Type:**
    *   Go to the new **CPT UI** menu in the admin panel.
    *   Click **Add/Edit Post Types**.
    *   For `Post Type Slug`, enter `service`.
    *   For `Plural Label`, enter `Services`.
    *   For `Singular Label`, enter `Service`.
    *   Scroll down to **Settings**. Find `Has Archive` and set it to `True`.
    *   Click **Add Post Type**. You should see a new "Services" menu appear in the sidebar!

2.  **Create the "Doctors" Post Type:**
    *   Repeat the process above.
    *   Slug: `doctor`, Plural: `Doctors`, Singular: `Doctor`.
    *   Make sure `Has Archive` is `True`.

3.  **Add Custom Fields to "Services":**
    *   Go to the new **Custom Fields** menu.
    *   Click **Add New** to create a Field Group. Name it `Service Fields`.
    *   Under **Location**, set the rule to `Show this field group if Post Type is equal to Service`.
    *   Now, add fields by clicking **+ Add Field**. Based on the architecture doc, create fields for:
        *   `service_price` (Field Type: `Text` or `Number`)
        *   `service_duration` (Field Type: `Text`)
        *   And any others listed in the documentation.

4.  **Add Custom Fields to "Doctors":**
    *   Create another Field Group named `Doctor Fields`.
    *   Set the Location rule to `Post Type is equal to Doctor`.
    *   Add fields for:
        *   `doctor_specialization` (Field Type: `Text`)
        *   `doctor_experience` (Field Type: `Number`)
        *   `doctor_photo` (Field Type: `Image`)

### Phase 4: Adding Content and Building the Site

With the structure in place, you can now add content and design the pages.

1.  **Populate Content:**
    *   Go to **Services > Add New** and create a few sample services. Fill in the standard title/description and the new custom fields you added.
    *   Go to **Doctors > Add New** and add the clinic's doctors.

2.  **Create the Main Pages:**
    *   Go to **Pages > Add New** and create the essential pages:
        *   `Главная` (Home)
        *   `О клинике` (About)
        *   `Контакты` (Contacts)
        *   `Политика конфиденциальности` (Privacy Policy)

3.  **Design the Home Page with Elementor:**
    *   Go to **Pages**, hover over the Home page, and click **Edit with Elementor**.
    *   Use the Elementor drag-and-drop interface to build the page. Your theme (MediPlus) will provide pre-built "widgets" or "blocks" you can use to quickly add sections for services, doctors, testimonials, etc.

4.  **Set Up Contact Forms:**
    *   Go to the **Contact** menu. You will see a default form.
    *   Edit it or create a new one. Name it "Contact Form".
    *   Go to the **Mail** tab and configure where the email notifications should be sent.
    *   Save the form. It will give you a **shortcode** (like `[contact-form-7 id="123" title="Contact form 1"]`).
    *   Edit your "Contacts" page and paste this shortcode into the text area. The form will appear on the page.

### Phase 5: Final Configuration and Launch Checks

The final polish before the site is ready.

1.  **Configure SEO:**
    *   Go to the new **Yoast SEO** menu. It will have a "First-time configuration" wizard. Follow it. It will ask for the organization name, logo, etc. This helps Google understand the site.

2.  **Configure Security and Performance:**
    *   **Wordfence:** Run the setup wizard. It will optimize the firewall.
    *   **WP Super Cache:** Go to **Settings > WP Super Cache**. Turn Caching **On** (the big button).

3.  **Set Up Backups:**
    *   Go to **Settings > UpdraftPlus Backups**.
    *   Go to the **Settings** tab and connect it to a remote storage location like Google Drive. Set a schedule for daily database backups and weekly file backups.

4.  **Final Launch Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Does the site look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop?
    *   [ ] Do all links and buttons work?
    *   [ ] Do the contact forms send emails correctly?
